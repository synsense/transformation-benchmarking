    "# Training spiking neural networks, *fast*\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiking neural networks (SNN) can be notoriously slow to train. A special case of recurrent neural network, they work with sequential inputs and rely on a form of gradient computation through time, which in the most common scenario is backpropagation through time. Given that events from event cameras or silicon cochlears have a temporal resolution of down to microseconds, the amount of time steps in data to train SNNs can easily go in the hundreds for a single sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "This would not be a problem if we trained on the extremely sparse data in continuous time directly, but the legacy of ANN machine learning frameworks has it that we have to work with dense tensors to train our SNN. That means that for a visual event stream input (think video) of spatial size (2, 128, 128) for channels, y and x we not only deal with some 10 frames per second but potentially hundreds per second, which increases input dimensions by a lot. \n",
    "\n",
    "When training a neural network of any kind, one might think about how the learning rate or model size affect training time. But when it comes to training *faster*, optimizing data movement is crucial. 3 out of the first 4 points in [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/kvs1ex/d_here_are_17_ways_of_making_pytorch_training/) weighted after potential speed-up have to do with how data is shaped and moved around between actual computations. It makes a huge difference, because training faster with the same hardware means getting results faster, and being able to iterate quicker.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this post we train an SNN using [Sinabs](https://github.com/synsense/sinabs) based on PyTorch and surrogate gradients, which means that in the forward pass we use the heavily quantized output of spiking layers but in the backward pass we use a smoother surrogate function based on the internal state of the neurons. We'll use the [Heidelberg Spiking Speech Commands](https://zenkelab.org/resources/spiking-heidelberg-datasets-shd/) dataset to train our network to do audio stream classification. We'll benchmark different data loading strategies using [Tonic](https://github.com/neuromorphs/tonic) and show that with the right strategy, we can achieve a speed-up of up to XX times compared to a na√Øve strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all our benchmarks, we already assume multiple worker loading threads and pinning the GPU memory. We'll increase throughput by using different forms of caching to disk or GPU. By applying deterministic transformations upfront and saving the new tensor, we can save a lot of time during training. \n",
    "\n",
    "All data from neuromorphic datasets in Tonic is provided as NxD numpy arrays. We'll need to transform this into a tensor to bring it to the GPU, and we'll also do some downsampling of time steps. Let's define the transforms for dense and sparse tensors. We know that the input data has 700 channels and about 0.8-1.2s samples with microsecond resolution. We'll downsample each sample to 100 channels, bin every 4 ms to one frame and cut samples that are longer than 1s. That leaves us with a maximum of 250 time steps per sample.\n",
